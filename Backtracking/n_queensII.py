### Problem Statement

N-Queend is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N x N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Input:
- An integer N, the size of the chessboard (N x N).

Output:
- A list of all possible solutions, where each solution is represented as a list of integers. Each integer represents the column position of the queen in that row.
- i.e. 2D Matrix with Queens.

In other words return a chessboard where no queen attacks each other in all directions (i.e. row, column, diagonal).
### Examples
Input:
    n = 4   
    
    
Posible Variations of this problem:
- Print one configuration of N-Queens.
- Print all configurations of N-Queens.
- Count the number of configurations of N-Queens.
